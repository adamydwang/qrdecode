## Contributing

The project is in maintenance mode, meaning, changes are driven by contributed patches.
Only bug fixes. The Barcode Scanner app can
no longer be published, so almost no fixes will be accepted for it.
There is otherwise no development or roadmap for this project.

Only proposed changes in the form of a pull request are likely to be acted on, but,
these will be acted on promptly.

### Questions

Questions should be asked on the mailing list:

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are not accepted.

### Bug Reports

Bug reports must have enough detail to understand and reproduce the problem. 
Bug reports without an associated pull request will generally be closed. 
However, bug reports with a pull request are likely to be merged promptly.
